## Usage

The main purpose of this app is for users that have items that they are looking to either sell or trade. Our app offers them the ability to list their items for other users to see and potentially buy or trade for it. To be able to list or trade products users will first have to become merchants through our SignUp Page but if someone is just looking to buy that won't be necessary. Users can buy from the Marketplace and list their items through they Activesales page.
